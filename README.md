## Status

Created as a placeholder in the Trek suite, this project is no longer maintained. Development was ceased very early in the Trek suite's lifetime when it became clear the original concept too closely mirrored a prior employer's unfinished product. The effort was halted out of an abundance of caution and respect for intellectual boundaries. This particular project never progressed beyond the initial planning phase for Trek.
